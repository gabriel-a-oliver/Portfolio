## COVID CRASHER | Gameplay/Level Engineer & Designer
See Game Image: https://rb.gy/iuxszx

*COVID CRASHER* is a game developed by me and four other classmates using the Unity Engine for my Introduction
to Game Development class at UWB. In this game, the player is a doctor who is shrunken in size and must navigate
through their patient’s respiratory system in order to defeat the COVID virus. My portion of the project was to
develop the game’s maps using Unity’s tile system, which made it easier to create and modify said maps. Developing
the maps went through multiple variations to improve the player experience. We discussed map changes and received
criticisms from classmates as well as our professor and I used this criticism to create a consistent color palette,
contrast the UI from the environment and detail the map with realistic organ structures. 

As part of our project for Introduction to Game Development, we needed to follow a theme: exponentials. Discussing
with the team, I was in charge of how we satisfied this theme by our game’s aesthetics and gameplay. The environmental
setting was to fight a virus that spreads exponentially in the respiratory system, and using a gameplay mechanic of the
cookie clicker. A cookie clicker is an object that you click for points which allows the player to purchase auto-clickers
to automate getting points, leading to exponential point growth. In addition, I scripted and implemented the player’s
movement, one of the boss’s attacks, set the enemy spawn locations, and designed enemy encounters. 

Our team was exceptional at communicating what needed to be done and following through on our goals as a team. We
knew our limits and allocated the appropriate amount of time and work we could achieve for that week. For example, we met
to discuss what needed to be done for our last sprint before the final presentation as well as how to present our final
project. We had a few UI and gameplay bugs in our game that needed to be fixed, as well as significant enemy/spawning
balancing issues and incomplete boss features so we had regular meetings in order to accommodate for debugging. We
allocated work to each group member responsibly and managed to complete each task successfully and on in a timely manner.

## Creating Interactable 3D Models & Customizable Cannon | CSS451 3-D Computer Graphics Course
See Folders of Images and Videos: tinyurl.com/3yl745ro

CSS451 3-D Computer Graphics course introduces practical and popular three-dimensional (3-D) graphic algorithms.
Examines modeling (how to build 3-D objects), animation (how to describe the motion of objects), and rendering
(how to generate images of 3-D objects in animation). In this course I collaborated with 1 classmate to build a mesh
and cylinder model that can be modified to have different number of vertices, a transformable texture, and direct 
vertex translation cababilities. In addition my team mate and I built a cannon that is fully transform interactive
that can shoot a ball into a hoop, incrementing the player's score. Both projects were done in Unity 3D, using C#.

The mesh model has a texture that can be translated, scaled, and rotated on the mesh. It has a set of n by n vertices
that can by translated with direct interaction from user's mouse. The mesh is calculated by a series of triangles made
from these vertices, with these triangles, I can calculate the triangles' and vertices' normals and display them with 
the white bars that appear when the user presses the "CTRL" key. I implemented the algorithm that calculates the number
of triangles, which triangles are owned by by which vertices, and how the normals appropriatly change after translation,
abstracting it to fit any number of n by n vertex resolution from 2 by 2 resolution to 20 by 20 resolution.

The cylinder model is similar to the mesh model in that I implemented the vertex-triangle algorithm. In addition, I added
the feature such that when 1 vertex is translated on the cylnder, the entire row of vertices translates in the same direction
from the center of the cylinder. The cylinder also has n by n vertices and can be rotated to represent 10 degrees of a cylinder
to the full 360 degrees of the cylinder.

The customizable cannon is made of 3 parent-child nodes that are each selectively tranformable. The grandparent node,
the base, can be translated to move the whole cannon around, and rotate. The parent node, the arm, can be scaled vertically
to increase the height of the cannon reach. And the child node, the barrel, can be rotated on the cannon's hinge pivot to
change the verticle angle the ball is fired at. What is interesting about this cannon is that each piece of the cannon is
actually at the cent of the world, and their meshes are actually relocated using TRS matrix algebra to be positioned in
their appropriate locations. In addition, the hoop is can be moved with direct interaction from the user's mouse, and
ball's texture can be swaped at any time.

## Mythos Studio | Assets for In-Development Roblox Game
See Folders of Images: https://rb.gy/doynnz

These assets were created for a game being developed by a small team of five developers. I designed
these models by myself using the software Blender. The Roblox engine requires asset developers to keep their
assets with low numbers of polygons to reduce the strain on the engine. As such, I have focused to make these
assets pleasing to look at while keeping the polygon count low.

I would receive criticism by my partners and make subsequent drafts to fit the game’s animations,
atmosphere, and game engine limitations.  An example of this was making multiple editions of the blacksmith pliers.
I developed multiple variations of this asset based on feedback from our team’s animator. He needed to animate a
blacksmith holding an item with these pliers, so I modified the plier’s asset to fit the character’s hand. As such,
I kept the open shape of the plier’s claws while closing its grip to fit the hand.
See Variations: https://rb.gy/gjc2ue, https://rb.gy/zs801y

These models are used for many aspects of the game including the game’s environment, animation, and user interface.
Many of them contribute to the game’s architecture, tools, weapons, nature, and user interface elements. A
significant amount of my work went into making tree variations, by request of one of our environment developers.
Although I have developed many more variations, I have included some of the assets used in the game

## Society of the Spectacle | Book Cover Design
See Folder of Images: https://rb.gy/4z1r2p

This project is from my Introduction to Design class where I had to create book a book cover for *Society of the
Spectacle* by Guy Debord. The goal of this project was to create a book cover that expresses the theme of the book, which
uses formal contrasts, and asymmetrical-dynamic design. The assignment was to be completed individually and required me to
make a 6 in. x 9 in. print which includes the name of the book and author and to use no outside sources. 

In brief, the book *Society of the Spectacle*, published in 1967, is about how society oppresses itself through
capitalism, media, and social pressures to keep the status quo. To create many different ideas, I made a mind map to figure
out what subjects I could create to express this theme, see here: https://rb.gy/gufoyp. After a couple of class critiques,
I noticed that my classmates were not abstracting the theme of the book, but rather focusing on an example of contemporary
social pressure. Acknowledging how my classmates were tackling the project, I had decided to make something unique and
abstract the theme and only using simple shapes to make the composition. My classmates were using Adobe Illustrator to
develop their book covers, but I found that the design I wished to make required 3D modelling. I decided to use Blender to
design the composition, noting that no other classmate was using 3D modelling to develop their book cover.

The first draft, here: https://rb.gy/chymex, was a large rectangle that casts a shadow on small circles. The idea being that
the circles strive to be something that they cannot, and it keeps them oppressed. Issues with this draft included its poor
lighting and portraying the idea that a separate force is oppressing the people, rather than the people oppressing themselves.
The second draft, here: https://rb.gy/myhyk1, fixed issues with the theme. However, it needed further development in its formal
contrasts and lighting. For the final version here: https://rb.gy/tndynr, I tightened the framing, fully desaturated the
colors, and increased the lighting contrast to represent the dismal tone of the book. Lastly, I added the book title and author
in the top left corner using Adobe Illustrator. I enlarged the words “Society” and “Spectacle” to pronounce their importance in
the book’s theme and imagery of the book cover. 

## Untitled Jam Game | Map Theme, AI A* Implementation, Enemy Parent Class, Melee Weapon, Health, and Speed-boost Programming
See Folder of Images: https://rb.gy/noivnu

*Untitled Jam Game* is a game I helped create in a team of three during the UW Game Developer Club Autumn 2019 Game Jam.
This was the first complete game I helped develop using the Unity Engine. The Game Jam had a retro theme. In the game, the
player controls a child in an arcade who can punch and pick up weapons and power-ups to fight videogame cartridges. With a total
of four waves, the enemies become harder as the waves progress, but the enemies drop more powerful power-ups.

My role in the group was to help program different facets of the game, such facets are the behaviors of the sprites
found in the link above. One element I helped create was the location of the game. Since the Game Jam has a retro theme, instead
of just having a retro art style, I suggested that the game takes place in an arcade, this will tie the game back to the Game
Jam theme but also give some fantasy context to the enemies the player character is fighting. See here: https://rb.gy/eaycid.

In addition, I helped implement A* artificial intelligence for the enemies. One of my group members created the AI for
enemies to attack the player, react to getting hit and chasing the player, the enemies would occasionally get stuck on terrain.
A* is a popular enemy AI for the Unity Engine. The AI will path around the terrain to reach the player character. I implemented
the AI so that the enemies still retain the AI characteristics that my other group member programmed.

Another contribution I made to the game was creating a general enemy class that the enemy inherent behaviors from, and
I did this by implementing the infrastructure to add behaviors. I also suggested making the health of the player character by a
coin and his melee weapon a Nintendo Power-Glove inspired glove, tying it back to the Game Jam theme and the arcade map. I
programmed that the “picking up a coin on the map would heal the player” aspect of this game as well as how the melee weapon
moves and damages enemies.

## RimeCraft | 3D Modeler and Texturer
See Folders of Images: https://rb.gy/ufygbb

*RimeCraft* is a game I helped create in a team of three during the UWB Husky Game Club Autumn 2020 Game Jam. The game is inspired
by *MineCraft* in which the player can destroy, collect, and place blocks in the world. The player has a tool that shoots a projectile
that reflects off of blocks, destroying them.

My role in the group was to develop the 3D model of the player's tool and texture the blocks in the game's world. I used Blender to 
develop the tool and appropriately defined the model's UV map to apply different textures to it. For the blocks, I used Blender and 
Adobe Photoshop to develop a cube's UV and tested different textures to see if it makes a block look distinct in the game world.

## Airsoft Gun Based on Halo SMG Design
See Folders of Images: https://rb.gy/7kjx7m

This project is an airsoft gun based on the design in the Halo series, here: https://rb.gy/sifkih. This is a personal project
for the purpose to play airsoft with a costume I designed. The target for this project is to create a custom airsoft gun that
has unique and practical uses for airsoft purposes. It will be approximately 16 in. x 7.75 in. x 2.75 in. This gun model is
unique in that the magazine that feeds the ammunition is on the side of the weapon, requiring a unique feeding mechanism, see
here: https://rb.gy/bwzqbx.

For this project, I self-taught myself 3D modeling using the software Blender to envision the design I wanted. I plan
to make this model CO2-powered, however the issue is that there are no side-fed gas airsoft guns made, which has led me to
research airsoft guns in order to create my own gas-mechanism to support this unique magazine feature.

The gun model shown above is made from EVA foam and it is showing a rough gas system for the magazine to feed the airsoft
gun. I’m using a hop-up system meant for electric powered side fed airsoft guns and this will attach to the CO2 container housed
in the stock of the airsoft gun, and the magazine will feed ammunition into the hop-up from the side, here: https://rb.gy/t6trku,
https://rb.gy/kgapzz. The airsoft gun is planned
to have collapsible grip and stock, here: https://rb.gy/mnwnk8.
