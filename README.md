##Mythos Studio’s Work | Assets for In-Development Roblox Game
These assets were created for a game in progress being developed by a small team of me and four other developers. I designed these models by myself using the software Blender. The Roblox engine requires asset developers to keep their assets with low numbers of polygons to reduce the strain on the engine. As such, I have focused to make these assets pleasing to look at while keeping the polygon count low.
I would get criticism by my coworkers and make subsequent drafts to fit the game’s animations, atmosphere, and game engine limitations. An example of this was making multiple editions of the blacksmith pliers. I developed multiple variations of this asset based on feedback from our team’s animator. He needed to animate a blacksmith holding an item with these pliers, so I modified the plier’s asset to fit the character’s hand. As such, I kept the open shape of the plier’s claws while closing its grip to fit the hand.
These models are used for many aspects of the game including the game’s environment, animation, and user interface. Many of them contribute to the game’s architecture, tools, weapons, nature, and user interface elements. A significant amount of my work went into making tree variations, by request of one of our environment developers. Although I have developed many more variations, I have included some of the assets used in the game above.
 
 
 
## COVID CRASHER | Level Designer, Gameplay Designer, Player Movement
	COVID CRASHER is a game developed by four classmates and I made, using the Unity Engine, for my Introduction to Game Development class at UWB in Spring 2020. In this game, the player is a doctor who is shrunken in size and must navigate through their patient’s respiratory system in order to defeat the COVID virus. My portion of the project was to develop the game’s maps using Unity’s tile system, which made it easier to create and modify said maps. Developing the maps went through multiple variations to improve the player experience. We discussed map changes and received criticisms from classmates as well as our professor and I used this criticism to create a consistent color palette, contrast the UI from the environment and detail the map with realistic organ structures. 
	As part of our project for Introduction to Game Development, we needed to follow a theme: exponentials. Discussing with the team, I was in charge of how we satisfied this theme by our game’s aesthetics and gameplay. The environmental setting was to fight a virus that spreads exponentially in the respiratory system, and using a gameplay mechanic of the cookie clicker. A cookie clicker is an object that you click for points which allows the player to purchase auto-clickers to automate getting points, leading to exponential point growth. In addition, I scripted and implemented the player’s movement, one of the boss’s attacks, set the enemy spawn locations, and designed enemy encounters. 
Our team was exceptional at communicating what needed to be done and following through on our goals as a team. We knew our limits and allocated the appropriate amount of time and work we could achieve for that week. For example, we met to discuss what needed to be done for our last sprint before the final presentation as well as how to present our final project. We had a few UI and gameplay bugs in our game that needed to be fixed, as well as significant enemy/spawning balancing issues and incomplete boss features so we had regular meetings in order to accommodate for debugging. We allocated work to each group member responsibly and managed to complete each task successfully and on in a timely manner.

## Society of the Spectacle | Book Cover Design
	Above is a project from my Introduction to Design class where I had to create book a book cover for Society of the Spectacle by Guy Debord. The goal of this project was to create a book cover that expresses the theme of the book, which uses formal contrasts, and asymmetrical-dynamic design. The assignment was to be completed individually and required me to make a 6 in. x 9 in. print which includes the name of the book and author and to use no outside sources. 
	In brief, the book Society of the Spectacle, published in 1967, is about how society oppresses itself through capitalism, media, and social pressures to keep the status quo. To create many different ideas, I made a mind map to figure out what subjects I could create to express this theme. After a couple of class critiques, I noticed that my classmates were not abstracting the theme of the book, but rather focusing on an example of contemporary social pressure. Acknowledging how my classmates were tackling the project, I had decided to make something unique and abstract the theme and only using simple shapes to make the composition. My classmates were using Adobe Illustrator to develop their book covers, but I found that the design I wished to make required 3D modelling. I decided to use Blender to design the composition, noting that no other classmate was using 3D modelling to develop their book cover.
	The first draft was a large rectangle that casts a shadow on small circles. The idea being that the circles strive to be something that they cannot, and it keeps them oppressed. Issues with this draft included its poor lighting and portraying the idea that a separate force is oppressing the people, rather than the people oppressing themselves. The second draft fixed issues with the theme. However, it needed further development in its formal contrasts and lighting. For the final version, I tightened the framing, fully desaturated the colors, and increased the lighting contrast to represent the dismal tone of the book. Lastly, I added the book title and author in the top left corner using Adobe Illustrator. I enlarged the words “Society” and “Spectacle” to pronounce their importance in the book’s theme and imagery of the book cover. 

	

















 

## Untitled Jam Game | Map Theme, AI A* Implementation, Enemy Parent Class, Melee Weapon, Health, and Speed-boost Programming
Untitled Jam Game is a game I helped create in a team of three during the UW Game Developer Club Autumn 2019 Game Jam. This was the first complete game I helped develop using the Unity Engine. The Game Jam had a retro theme. In the game, the player controls a child in an arcade who can punch and pick up weapons and power-ups to fight videogame cartridges. With a total of four waves, the enemies become harder as the waves progress, but the enemies drop more powerful power-ups.
My role in the group was to help program different facets of the game, such facets are the behaviors of the sprites above. One element I helped create was the location of the game. Since the Game Jam has a retro theme, instead of just having a retro art style, I suggested that the game takes place in an arcade, this will tie the game back to the Game Jam theme but also give some fantasy context to the enemies the player character is fighting.
In addition, I helped implement A* artificial intelligence for the enemies. One of my group members created the AI for enemies to attack the player, react to getting hit and chasing the player, the enemies would occasionally get stuck on terrain. A* is a popular enemy AI for the Unity Engine. The AI will path around the terrain to reach the player character. I implemented the AI so that the enemies still retain the AI characteristics that my other group member programmed.
Another contribution I made to the game was creating a general enemy class that the enemy inherent behaviors from, and I did this by implementing the infrastructure to add behaviors. I also suggested making the health of the player character by a coin and his melee weapon a Nintendo Power-Glove inspired glove, tying it back to the Game Jam theme and the arcade map. I programmed that the “picking up a coin on the map would heal the player” aspect of this game as well as how the melee weapon moves and damages enemies. 


























  
## Airsoft Gun Based on Halo SMG Design
	This project is an airsoft gun based on the design in the Halo series. This is a personal project for the purpose to play airsoft with a costume I designed. The target for this project is to create a custom airsoft gun that has unique and practical uses for airsoft purposes. It will be approximately 16 in. x 7.75 in. x 2.75 in. This gun model is unique in that the magazine that feeds the ammunition is on the side of the weapon, requiring a unique feeding mechanism.
	For this project, I self-taught myself 3D modeling using the software Blender to envision the design I wanted. I plan to make this model CO2-powered however the issue is that there are no side-fed gas airsoft guns made, which has lead me to research airsoft guns in order to create my own gas-mechanism to support this unique magazine feature.


	The gun model shown above is made from EVA foam and it is showing a rough gas system for the magazine to feed the airsoft gun. I’m using a hop-up system meant for electric powered side fed airsoft guns and this will attach to the CO2 container housed in the stock of the airsoft gun, and the magazine will feed ammunition into the hop-up from the side. The airsoft gun is planned to have collapsible grip and stock.
